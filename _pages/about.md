THello, I'm Pranav Shirole, and this is my Data Science blog. I'm a data science enthusiast interested in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I taught myself how to code and ever since then I've been on an erudition journey, learning about artificial intelligence concepts and deep learning libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow. I have previous experience in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a background in Engineering and Statistics, Web Development, and UI/UX Design. I also hold a Masters degree in Industrial Engineering from [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/).

This is my way of showcasing my data science skills and the related projects I have worked on. You may use [Tags](https://shirolepranav.github.io/blog/categories/) in navigation to get an overview of the tools and techniques used in the projects. You can also use [Search](https://shirolepranav.github.io/blog/search/) to look for specific keywords that might interest you, so as to narrow down your search. Please feel free to reach out to me in case you would like to work together.
