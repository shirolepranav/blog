    "A *class* is like an object constructor, a \"blueprint\" for creating objects. It allows you to define a data structure and its behavior, and store data. With classes, you can create reusable components, and group data and operations together.  \n",

    "#### Creating a class\n",
    "The names of the classes use Pascal casing.  \n",
    "An *object* is a unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both, data members and methods.  \n",
    "A *class variable* is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods.  \n",
    "An *instance* is an individual object of a certain class. For e.g., an object `obj` that belongs to a class `People` is an instance of the class.  \n",
    "A *method* is nothing but a function that is defined within a class.  \n",
    "An *instance variable* is a variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.  \n",
    "*Constructors* are used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize (assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created.  \n",
    "In Python, the `__init__()` method is called the class constructor or initialization method, and it is always called when an object is created (constructed).  \n",
    "The first parameter of `__init__` is `self`, which  is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class. Note that it is not a keyword in Python and it does not have to be named `self`. You can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class. After that, we go ahead and set up any additional parameters that we may want.  \n",
    "Then you define a field or property using `self.<parameter_name>`. So whenever we create an instance of the class, the `self` will refer to a different instance from which we are accessing class properties or methods.  \n",
    "Then you can add any methods that you want, and the methods can involve any of the instantiated parameters, with the exception that the first argument to each method is `self`. Python adds the `self` argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods."
